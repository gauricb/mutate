  You are an expert at programming in {target_lang}, and need to determine if two pieces of {target_lang} code are functionally equivalent.

  Here is source code A that we know works correctly:

  """
  {correct_translation}
  """

  And here is source code B that should be functionally equivalent to source code A from above:

  """
  {generated_translation}
  """

  You will need to follow these steps to complete the task:

  1. Look at both source code A and source code B, identifying how each part of the code works, and what they are supposed to do.
  2. Determine whether or not the behavior, logic, and functionality of source code A is the same as in source code B.
  3. Check source code B for any errors or issues which would limit its functionality.

  Let's think step by step, and state "True" if the two pieces of {target_lang} code are functionally equivalent. Otherwise state "False", and in both cases do not include anything else in the response:
